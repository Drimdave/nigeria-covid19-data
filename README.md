# Nigeria Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Public Dataset
This dataset contains the latest available public data on COVID-19 disease in Nigeria. On 11th of March, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) [declared the COVID-19 virus outbreak as a global pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020). Even though the outbreak originated from Wuhan in China, its spread across the globe has been very rapid and demands actions informed by data.
